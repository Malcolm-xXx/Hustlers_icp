# Flutter(dart) + ICP

This project integrates **Flutter** for the front-end development and **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** for the back-end and hosting. 

Hustlers App is a platform designed to connect users with local service providers, or "hustlers," who help run errands and complete tasks based on usersâ€™ needs. The app allows users to create a list of items or tasks, set a budget, and find nearby hustlers to fulfill their requests. It features a seamless user experience where users can manage their tasks, track progress, and handle payments through an integrated wallet system.

Built using Flutter for a responsive, cross-platform experience, and powered by Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for secure and scalable back-end operations, the Hustlers App is designed to streamline daily tasks efficiently.
